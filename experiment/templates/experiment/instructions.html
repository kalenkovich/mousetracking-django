        Instructions
    </h1>

    <p>
        The task will always start when you press the "Start" button in the bottom of the screen.
        After you do, we will show you a frame with 2-4 images like the one below.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will need to memorize the objects in it.
        A question will then start playing in your headphones (please use headphones during the experiment).
        Please play a sample question below to familiarize yourself with the type of questions you will hear.
        This is also a good time to adjust the volume to a comfortable level.
    </p>

    <p>
        While the question is playing, two images from the frame will appear in the top corners of the screen.
        Only one of the images constitutes a correct answer to the question you just heard.
        Click the correct one using your mouse (no touchpad!).
        Below is an example of two such images.
    </p>

    <p>
        The question audio also contains a series of beeps (play the sample question again to hear them).
        You will need to try to select an answer before the last one of the beeps.
        The beep series will always have the same duration.
    </p>

    <p>
        The task will be repeated multiple times separated into 9 blocks.
        Feel free to take a break between the block.
        We ask you, however, to try to avoid taking breaks within blocks.
    </p>

    <p>
        The experiment must be run in the fullscreen mode.
        At the beginning of each block, you will see a pop-up with a button that will turn the fullscreen mode on.
        To exit the fullscreen mode press the "Esc" button.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, please turn off your phone and notifications on your computer for the duration of the experiment.
        In case you have any questions (now, or during the experiment) feel free to contact the experimenter.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before continuing on to the task itself, we'll go through a couple of practice rounds so that you can familiarize
        yourself with the procedure.
    </p>
